## Design Decisions

- The original typeface is *Damaged Guts*. I chose a free alternative called *CF Punk Fashion* as a basis for making my own text. I converted the text to SVG paths and added more "damage" to get closer to the look of the original!
- I chose to do the animation in CSS, but have it triggered by JavaScript. I did begin by using GSAP and noticed that the equivalent of `translateX(50%)` didn't work as expected. It works as expected in CSS. I don't know why!
