# Title sequences (TV shows and movies)

This project creates web versions of the title sequences from TV Shows and Movies. The aim is to improve my CSS and animation chops.

You can **view all of the title sequences in [this collection on codepen](https://codepen.io/collection/nNmwgP)**.

## Run the project

You can run the **project locally as a mini-website**. To run the project: clone the repo, install the dependencies with your package manager of choice, and run the dev server with `dev` npm script.

```shell
# using npm
npm i 
npm run dev
```

The website is run by default on: <http://localhost:3000/>.

#### Implementation notes

I created 2 versions:
1. Using the [Greensock (GSAP)](https://greensock.com/) library that features the soundtrack. See [schitts-creek/gsap folder](schitts-creek/gsap) for code.
1. A CSS version without the soundtrack. See [schitts-creek/css folder](schitts-creek/css) for code.

#### Implementation notes

The animation is a CSS animation, but uses JavaScript to toggle a class to trigger the animation.

- The original typeface is _Damaged Guts_. I chose a free alternative called _CF Punk Fashion_ as a basis for making my own text. I converted the text to SVG paths and added more "damage" to get closer to the look of the original!
- I chose to do the animation in CSS, but have it triggered by JavaScript. I did begin by using GSAP and noticed that the equivalent of `translateX(50%)` didn't work as expected. It works as expected in CSS. I don't know why!
