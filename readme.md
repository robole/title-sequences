# Title sequences (TV shows and movies)

This project creates a web version of the title sequences from TV Shows and Movies. The aim is to improve my CSS and animation chops.

I have bundled the project with a [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), so it can be run a mini-website.

## Run the project

To clone and run the project, run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robole/title-sequences
cd title-sequences
npm i
npm run dev
```

The website is run on: <http://localhost:3000/>.

If you open the project in VS Code, there is a task that will start the dev server every time you open the project. The first time you open the project, you may need to run the command **"Tasks: Manage Automatic Tasks in Folder"** to enable it. Otherwise you can run the command `npm run dev` to start the dev server yourself.
